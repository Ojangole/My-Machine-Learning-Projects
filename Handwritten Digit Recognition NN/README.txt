Built as exercise 4 of the Stanford Machine Learning Certification by Andrew Ng. 

The model is located in the ex4.m file of the Handwritten Digit Recognition NN subfolder 
and the supporting files and sample data is used as described in the ex4.m file as described by Instructions.pdf.

In this project, I
- Designed and developed a 2 layer Neural Network that classifies digits. 
- Utilized a mathematical model to compute cost function to ensure accuracy and obtain sigmoid gradient to update weights and biases during backpropagation to train data.
- Implemented with Octave using Octave GUI and CLI.
