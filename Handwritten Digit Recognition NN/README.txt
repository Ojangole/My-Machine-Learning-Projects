Built as exercise 4 of the Stanford Machine Learning Certification by Andrew Ng. 

The model is located in the ex4.m file of the Handwritten Digit Recognition NN subfolder 
and the supporting files and sample data is used as described in the ex4.m file as described by Instructions.pdf.

In this project, I
- Designed and developed a 2 layer Neural Network that classifies digits. 
- Created a mathematical model to compute cost function, obtain sigmoid gradient and implement backpropagation.
- Built with Octave using Octave GUI and CLI. The model used cost function in each layer to assess its accuracy.
