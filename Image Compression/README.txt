Built as exercise 7 of the Stanford Machine Learning Certification by Andrew Ng. 

The model is located in the ex7.m file of the Image Compression subfolder 
and the supporting files and sample data is used as described in the ex7.m file as described by Instructions.pdf.

In this project, I
- Designed and developed a model that uses Principal Component Analysis and K-means to compress images. 
- Utilized a mathematical model to find closest centroids and compute them to learn the image data and use the K-means algorithm to compress the image.
- Implemented in Octave using Octave GUI and CLI.
