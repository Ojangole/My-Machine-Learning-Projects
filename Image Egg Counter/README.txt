Image Egg counter

● Designed and developed a model to count the number of circular items/eggs in an image.

● Built with Python and NumPy Library using HoughCircles and Distance Transform with Watershed Algorithm to find circular items/eggs in the image.

● Can be improved by calculating accuracy by comparing the number of circled eggs in HoughCirles implementation with those in Distance Transform or with a manual number of circular items/eggs in the picture.
