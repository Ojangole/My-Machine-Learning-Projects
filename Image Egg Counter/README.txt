● Designed and developed a COVID 19 prediction model to predict deaths, confirmed cases and recovered cases using features like
location, population, deaths and previous COVID cases.

● Built with Python, Pandas and SciKit-Learn Library through a Jupyter notebook on Kaggle using Standard Scaler feature
engineering technique to prepare the data and a random forest regressor to generate predictions.

● Obtained model accuracy of 79% using the mean absolute percentage error method. Can be improved by training more data and
hyperparameter tuning.
