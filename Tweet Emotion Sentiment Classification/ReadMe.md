The tweet emotion recognition project aims to identify the emotion expressed by a tweet, such
as joy, sadness, anger, etc by analyzing social media data from platforms such as X. This project
can be applied to understanding customer feedback and enhancing human-computer
interaction. 

However, tweet emotion recognition is challenging because tweets are short,
informal, and often contain slang, emojis, and hashtags. Therefore, a standard natural language
processing model may not be able to capture the nuances and context of the tweets.

The project will aim to create and train a (Recurrent Neural Network) RNN model that can
handle tweet emotion recognition. It will also create a Na√Øve Bayes model for tweet emotion
recognition and compare the results of the two models.
