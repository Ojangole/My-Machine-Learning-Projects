Built as exercise 6 of the Stanford Machine Learning Certification by Andrew Ng. 

The model is located in the ex6.m file of the Spam Classifier subfolder 
and the supporting files and sample data is used as described in the ex6.m file as described by Instructions.pdf.

In this project, I
- Designed and developed a spam classifier using a Support Vector Machine to learn a decision boundary between spam and not-spam. 
- Utilized a mathematical model to a implement gaussian kernel for use with the Support Vector Machine.
- Implemented in Octave using Octave GUI and CLI. The model used cost function in each layer to assess its accuracy.
