Hue, putting the shoe on the other foot is enlightening. Not just Anglos moving into Italian neighbourhoods, but as a more ""old stock Canadian"" problem, Anglos moving into historically French neighbourhoods too. 

But the next paragraph

>Yet somehow we continue to get along in that messy, make-do, good-enough Canadian way. To his credit, Kaufmann notes that liberals don’t feel the same uneasy response to diversity felt by conservatives. Even when they perceive a decline in local solidarity, they more than compensate with their broader social networks to re-establish the sense of trust, familiarity, and social intimacy that may be fleeting at the door-to-door level. Of course, the Muslims that a well-off professor confers with in his workplace may be completely different from the refugee family that moves into the neighbouring flat in an East End London council estate where unemployment levels are high and social services are degraded. Perceptions and responses will vary accordingly. But to blame the immigrants for the reactions they generate hardly seems fair — and Kaufmann notes that even anxious working-­class whites with chips on their shoulders soften their hostile responses once they actually get to know the newcomers. Which of course should make you wonder why their precious white-identity worries need be validated in the first place.

I like how Kaufmann takes note of softening attitudes, almost as if this resentment comes from ignorance. 

>[...] But Kaufmann is less concerned about the validity of white fears than about the reality of the way they are exploited by rabble-­rousing tabloids and noisy politicians. Liberals should cede ground to unhappy conservatives, he insists, in order to defuse the mounting racial tension.

I think this review really tears out the heart of their book. 

>Kaufmann isn’t a politician, though he clearly aims to shape policy. A demographer specializing in ethnic studies, he got his start researching the once powerful Orange Order, a conservative British-Canadian fraternal organization that lobbied for the perpetuation of Anglo-­Protestant imperialist values as the true expression of Canadian character before post-war immigrations patterns shifted, colonial British loyalty dissipated rapidly, and a unifying form of multiculturalism was devised to fill the gaping void at the heart of an elusive national identity that might otherwise rapidly Americanize. 

Aww fuck, you mean my fanfiction about a Imperial Commonwealth Federation is unrealistic? Better uninstall Hearts of Iron IV. 

>His notion of whiteness is collective, conservative, and far too easily generalized as a result, because it is rooted in this monolithic past of British power and glory to which alien interlopers had to submit if they wanted to feel accepted. 

Whiteness is not Monolithic, just like how all native people aren't the same tribe. White Supremacists are proud of who they are, but if you tell them they can't be proud of other white peoples things they act as if you cut off their arms. If they wanted to consider themselves cosmopolitan how can they also be conservative, mixing all whiteness into a pool to pick and choose from (and not preserving their intra-European identities?).

IDK if I can read this book when not only would it raise my blood pressure, it's already been torn apart on the internet? 

>It’s in essence a unifying British royal family approach to a far more complex world: the Queen may well be a Church of England Christian with an outmoded accent and bizarre fashion sense who’s tied to centuries of unearned conservative, aristocratic, racial, religious, and cultural superiority, and yet she somehow manages to represent each and every one of us.

Oh, okay so I have to read it now in order to play WW2 games correctly. 

>The genius of such traditional and long-lasting WASP institutions, white-­identity supporters say, is their combination of entrenched solidity, which maintains social cohesion and a fixed identity over time, and broad flexibility, which allows a wide range of citizens to project their own personal values onto a shared symbol of community. (Sadly for this argument, white-pride advocates find it too easy to appropriate these supposedly universal white symbols: consider how the English flag of St. George is aggressively wielded by militant racists.)

Or the Red Ensign, Canadas old flag being the name of Canadas Nationalist Party. I remember on Reddit there was someone on OGFT defending it I think, and on the CBC before that. 



But the Red Ensign already seems to me, firmly in the grasp of nationalists who want us to remain this WASPy path. Trying to reclaim it for a multicultural Canada is pointless. We have the big Maple Leaf flag already, you don't need both. 

>You may have heard echoes of this primal Anglo-­Saxon attitude in the Harper government’s faltering attempts to make Canadians feel more connected to a fixed definition of common heritage by touting the bicentennial of the War of 1812 as a cause for grand national celebrations. No surprise, it didn’t catch on as a modern nation-building exercise.

I was saying boo-urns. 

>The centennial of the First World War likewise failed to capture the broader public imagination, which was surely a matter of regret to historians eager to revisit the charged relationship between an emerging pan-Canadian identity, independent of Old World alliances, and the narrower, more belligerent assertions of patriotic British imperialism — these quarrels about who gets to claim ownership of cultural identity do indeed go back a long way and aren’t the product of some modern multicultural conspiracy, despite Kaufmann’s frequent assertions.

And by all metrics they were. English had not yet dominated the Islands in the early 19th century so there were many languages. The Irish were considered a lesser people by the English. You can find texts from the 19th century talking about the ""English race"" or ""French race"", which today would seem downright strange. Throw in a huge native influence and all the languages that would have been spoken and you basically have a multicultural society. This idea that they were all white and so it wasn't a problem to live together or couldnt be multicultural when they figured out how to live together is to not step out of your own time and actually look at what people thought about one another. 

Being Christian wasn't enough and the 19th century was utterly filled with religious division despite everyone being Christian. The Orange Order were fierce protestants and Catholics (let alone French speaking ones) were not viewed as allies to them. The Irish also had to choose between a people who spoke French, yet were Catholic, or people who spoke English yet were protestant (this is more late 19th early 20th).

Secondly, the political escalation on the right is not classically neo-nazi or white supremacist, although people like to use these labels.

The nationalist right doesn't have an issue with Jewish people, its the other minorities that get their ire. And although there is antisemitism that exists on the right (separate far right groups), its not any different now than it has been historically. Ironically, antisemitism is growing more on the extreme left (look at the Women's march for example and the issues they are dealing with).

The van attack last year, can not be easily said to originate from any of those groups mentioned either. The driver's motive isn't clear but public accounts suggest its related to the world view of the 'incel' crowd. Incels are neither white supremacist nor neo-nazi, since it is not bound politically or racially. It serves no one's interest to misinform others about the ideological underpinnings of an individual's extremism.

Keep in mind that Bill 96 gives language inspectors and the Minister broad powers to order police to search without a warrant any personal device anywhere in Quebec except a private home if a language inspector or Minister gives the order to do so:

>111. “A person making an inspection for the purposes of this Act may

> 
>Any person who has custody, possession or control of documents referred to in this section must communicate them to the person making an inspection and facilitate their examination by that person.” [](

The notwithstanding clause was invoked broadly to override all the fundamental civil rights in the Charter that may apply in such a language inspection:

>Constitution Act, 1982 (Schedule B to the Canada Act, chapter 11 in the 1982

That eliminates protections against unreasonable search and seizure (section 8), arbitrary detention (section 9), the right to counsel, to be informed of the reason for arrest (section 10), the right to a trial, to the presumption of innocence, and to be informed of charges against you (section 11), protection against cruel and unusual punishment (section 12), protection against self incrimination (section 13), the right to an interpreter (section 14), and equality rights (section 15).

Well this is both hilarious and perhaps telling. Poilievre doesn't know enough about Vancouver's most notorious neighbourhood to locate it on a map. Evidently he didn't talk to anyone who does either. But he is also clearly talking to an audience that doesn't know or care.

Poilievre wants to be Prime Minister. If he's ahead in the polls it certainly suggests he can, and that his approach to building a viable coalition is working. Most importantly, this sends a powerful signal to the Conservative caucus: Poilievre is a winner. Caucus dissension is deadly for the Tories - Bernier's sour grapes cost them dozens of seats in 2019 and 2021, and a caucus revolt ended O'Toole's reign. 

Additional scrutiny is also not necessarily bad for Poilievre, given his style of politics. The right-wing populist strategy revels in attention. Populists don't actually win by having popular positions (basically none of Trump's policies were popular, and his approval ratings were toxic). They win by *setting the agenda*. 

If Poilievre is treated by the media as a PM in waiting he will be able to say many things that shape what gets debated in politics. And he is going to do so in a manner that shifts debate towards his preferred frame: ""are you with the corrupt Laurentian elite, or the good ordinary people from real Canada?"" He wants to set himself up as the Vox Populi - the legitimate voice of ""real Canadians"" (a distinction that he will flesh out rhetorically).

Torontonians have already seen this in the 2010 mayoral election. Rob Ford thrived on pushback from journalists. Being despised by the Toronto Star worked well for him, especially because he was able to make it seem as if that ire also extended to many Torontonians who were like him. It helped turn the election into a referendum on whether you identified with Rob Ford instead of being a question about whose policies served you best. Federally, Poilievre has the additional advantage that in an FPTP election he only needs about 38% of us to win convincingly.

As someone repulsed by the anti-intellectual and anger-driven politics that Poilievre champions, I find myself increasingly frustrated with the liberals. That they haven't done *everything* in their power to push down real estate prices, and specifically identified ""mom-and-pop investors"" as not people they want to target is a comically stupid strategic blunder (in addition to being bad for society at large, but who cares about that). As most ""strongman"" type politicians do, Poilievre offers simple solutions to complex problems in a way that won't work and may not even be attempted were he to come to power. But when the governing party offers *no solutions* then that's all there is. 

Meanwhile the liberals are happily burning political capital on further restricting firearm ownership in Canada ways with no real effect on public safety. They correctly identified that many urban voters support this, but really that support is borderline indifference and doesn't balance out their other shortcomings.

Every party has a shelf-life. Ultimately when voters have had enough they vote them out. When that mood dominates, the opposition (and whatever flaws they have) basically doesn't matter.

The NDP has variously pushed for half a million additional units of affordable housing, increased investment in co-ops, crown corp telecom to lower prices, paid sick days, anti-scab legislation, universal dental and pharmacare, and an inquiry into grocery profits. They could definitely go further but they're really not getting out-lefted by the conservatives.

- He pretty much just said, word for word, what Obama said in his 2008 campaign. ""Hope and change for the middle class"" etc. Obama pretty directly pointed at this when he visited Parliament, too.

Do too much and they contribute to inflation. Do too little and they get accuses of being uncaring, out of touch, having no empathy for those who are struggling.

That all said, there were steps that could have been taken that would not have put undue inflationary pressure on the economy and shown they care more for people than their dogma.

Cut the carbon tax on fuel. Fuel costs were amongst the highest inflationary pressures. Now I understand that the climate is important. But with fuel prices rising by 50 cents, 60 cents per litre, due to the global energy market going haywire because of the war in Ukraine, that increase was more than any carbon tax in terms of driving down demand. But Canadians still needed to drive, and when it becomes a choice of filling up the car or buying food, a little empathy would not have hurt them in this regard.

They could have offered support for low income Canadians, not low income families, low income Canadians, way earlier. This would have helped with the food or fuel crisis many people were having, and this money wouldn't have gone to non discretionary spending for the most part. Saying that childcare deals and a planned CCB increase not only did absolutely nothing for those without kids, or kids of daycare age, but it also gave money to those well above the low income spectrum.

And lastly, messaging. And honest chat with Canadians about what the GoC could and couldn't do would have gone a long way. Hey, I cannot simply give everyone 1000s of dollars, it will make inflation worse and I would be fighting the BoC. That would be helpful, and counter some of what PP was raging about. Or even, hey, I know this sucks, but its because of the war in Ukraine, and us being hammered with high inflation is a bit of the price we need to pay in order to support Ukraine in their struggle.

While STV may allow for small parties with some support to gain seats, trying to sell the public on a more complicated system will just result, I think, in FPTP remaining as our system of choice.

With IRV, you tell people ""nothing about ridings or parliament changes. What changes is how you vote. Instead of one X, you rank 1, 2, 3, and so on until you don't want to put any more choices down. If this means you just want to put 1 next to conservative that is fine. We count first choice like we normally do now. If nobody is over 50%, we eliminate the candidates with fewest votes and count those second choices, and we keep eliminating until someone goes over 50%. This lets people to vote their conscience but still say they would rather have the liberals beat the conservatives. We can still have majorities but results better match popular vote percentages.""

That takes a minute, maybe two. STV you have to explain super ridings and vote quotas and what kind of ranks do what and so on.

How long exactly are trans people supposed to be expected to justify their existence to people who want them to disappear? How long are they supposed to be expected to debate transphobes on topics that have long been settled in the sociological and medical fields? How much work do they have to have put in to finally be emancipated and to expect the basic level of respect afforded to the rest of society?

It feels as though a lot of people treat LGBTQ issues as a policy matter and not as the human rights question that it is. When it comes to the trans community as a subset of the queer community, the question to be answered is, ""should this minority group which is different from the majority be protected as a different yet equally valid representation of the human experience?"", and I think the answer is pretty obvious. No one in this world should have to fight to justify their existence, everyone should be left to live their lives in a way that they see fit so far as it does not bring direct harm to anyone else, and if you don't understand how or why people would live their lives different, you should at least understand that they may feel the same way about you.

7131,"Even for an editorial, I am not sure this qualifies as journalism. I would accuse of Barbara Kay of not actually reading Dr. Cass’s interim report, but I think it is far more likely she is being intentionally dishonest in this article. This falls well below any sense of ethical journalistic standards. Kay says that Dr. Cass “condemned the GIDS model.” Kay doesn’t even mention long wait lists or inadequate staffing. Kay also implies the report mentions “undue influence of political actors, such as trans activist groups Mermaids and Stonewall.”

The interim report does none of those things. It affirms the GIDS model, among others, while identifying room for further research and improvement. But the report primarily focuses on the overly long wait lists and inadequate staffing at Tavistock. The fact this is not mentioned in Kay’s article demonstrates a very high degree of dishonesty in her writing. According to a separate report by the Care Quality Commission, 26% of Tavistock patients waited more than two years for their first appointment. Two thirds of patients waited more than a year. Furthermore, the words “Mermaids”, “Stonewall”, and “politic” (or any variation of the word “politic”) are not even in Dr. Cass’s interim report.

At the VERY BEGINNING of her interim report, Dr. Cass addresses her audience by saying the following:

“I understand that as you read this letter some of you may be anxious because you are waiting to access support from the NHS around your gender identity. Maybe you have tried to get help from your local services, or from the Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS), and because of the long waiting lists they have not yet been able to see you. I hope that some of you have had help – maybe from a supportive GP, a local Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS), or from GIDS. I have heard that young service users are particularly worried that I will suggest that services should be reduced or stopped. I want to assure you that this is absolutely not the case – the reverse is true. I think that more services are needed for you, closer to where you live. The GIDS staff are working incredibly hard and doing their very best to see you as quickly as possible but providing supportive care is not something that can be rushed – each young person needs enough time and space for their personal needs to be met. So, with the best will in the world, one service is not going to be able to respond to the growing demand in a timely way. I am advising that more services are made available to support you.”

The interim report goes on to conclude that:

“5.32. Overall, GIDS faces a daunting task as a single provider in managing risk on the waiting list, seeing new referrals, reviewing and supporting those on hormone treatment, undertaking an ongoing transformation programme, recruiting and training new staff and trying to retain existing staff. This suggests that the current model is not sustainable and that another model is needed.”

Ultimately, the interim report recommends the creation of multiple regional clinics that specialize in treating gender-questioning children and gender dysphoria. But don’t take my own or Kay’s word for it – go read the report yourself. Read Dr. Cass’s more recent letter to the National Health Service as well. I am left utterly baffled that so many right-wing ""news"" outlets (National Post, National Catholic Register, The Spectator, Daily Mail, etc.) have latched onto this as some type of perceived win against “radical gender theorists”, which to be clear, is a phrase that is only ever used in earnest by clowns.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There have been more than a few dollars. There has been a substantial scale-up of funding for first nations programs, priorities and supports since 2015. 

Naturally, it is not enough. There is 400 years worth of damage, including 150 odd years of forced kidnapping with physical and sexual abuse of generations of indigenous people, serial forced relocation to enforce economic deprivation, massive infrastructure deficits and cumulative consequent disastrous health and social problems.

In terms of what separates Trudeau from other Prime Ministers, that would be the scale of investment, the ""no strings"" nature of the investments, and the willingness to engage in negotiation rather than police confrontation. The pipeline blockades are a clear example of contrast. The Conservative plan was:

1. Send police/the army to clear all blockades immediately;
2. Offer funding/negotiation with strings to allow the pipeline;
3. Dictate who they would negotiate with.

The Liberal government:

1. Allowed the protests without confrontation;
2. Negotiated with the people selected for negotiation by the internal law of the Wet'suwet'en (although now the elected Council has decided, after the fact, to offer a half-hearted psuedo-protest to this decision, without taking a clear position on who has the right to negotiate for the people);
3. Offered negotiation without requiring capitulation on the pipeline.

Oh certainly, throwing money at the problem and calling that a solution is done by both CPC & LPC governments. And yet the problem remains.

To be blunt, Mr. Trudeau has indeed attempted the ""spending announcement"" tactic. And so did his predecessors including Mr. Harper.

So to use ""he's spent money"" as proof that he's the most ""pro-indigenous"" Prime Minister ever is absurd because it puts him into the same category as the previous Prime Minister from the opposing party.

Now to be clear, my point is not that Jean Chretien, Paul Martin & Stephen Harper were all terrible on the file or all fantastic. My point is that the change between the three of them and Mr. Trudeau is on points without substance.

You're also wrong on the CPC government response to blockades. The idea that the police and the army were ""immediately"" sent in is simply not true.

No it wouldn't. And doesn't currently. MSM can safely donate blood with little to no risk. The science is there to prove it right now, and you can look at other countries that allow it for that evidence in action. You can even do some basic napkin statistics to show it on your own. 

To start off with some basics, we are going to assume that people with HIV aren't going to donate, and that people answering the questionnaires are going to be truthful. Otherwise this is pointless because we'd be assuming that people are willfully trying to harm the blood supply and that isn't limited to any community.

First there are an estimated [9,090 people with HIV remained undiagnosed in 2016.]( Lets make a big assumption and have MSM make up 51.9% of that since they make up that percentage of HIV cases already. Laving us with 4718 MSM with undiagnosed HIV.

[1/60 Canadians gave blood last year]( Apply that same ratio to the undiagnosed HIV group of MSM and you're left with 78 people. That's another big assumption too.

Now without any sort of blood testing or dangerous activity surveys you have 78 donations you're worried about in the country every year.

 The current blood testing is very very effective, nearing 100% 99.99% accuracy leaves us with 0.0078 of a donation. However, the blood is tested 2 times by CBS, using different testing methods. So really it's 0.00000078 of a donation. Altering the questionnaire to account for the more at risk behaviour, and altering the deferral period to reflect that *like we do for straight people now* is more than enough to make up the risk.

My math above is bad. I need a computer to do my statistical analysis normally. I made a bunch of assumptions that aren't quite reality. Here are some more resources from smarter experts about why the ban and long term deferral rates are biased and outdated.

All forms of HIV testing have windows after infection in which they are not very sensitive. It takes over a month for antibody tests to become reliable, and over a week for NAT to become reliable.

It's a rather small false negative window, but it's real enough. 

If one false negative slipping through meant a risk of 1 HIV infection, it would probably be a tolerable risk. But some blood products are pooled, with the donor's blood being pooled with hundreds of other donors to make products for hundreds of recipients.

- In 1993 in Toronto, illegal firearms were certified without doubt to be responsible for [""52 percent of homicides where a firearm was recovered; and 68 percent of incidents in which a real gun was seized""](

- Since that time, it's known that gang violence has skyrocketed in Toronto specifically, which would rationally lead to this figure increasing in the last 25 years, not decreasing.
