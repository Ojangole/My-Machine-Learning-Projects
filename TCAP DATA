9050,"If you want to craft policy designed to hurt women, increase subsidization for single motherhood. The single greatest predictor for intergenerational poverty and criminality is single parenthood, and being raised by a single parent.

Pretending like we actually need to move past the idea of the traditional family is an idea guaranteed to hurt everyone, and disproportionately women.

Government subsidy is measurably not an acceptable substitute for a father in the family.

9051,"Helping single mothers in particular is really important because they are raising the children most likely to commit crimes and be a drain on society in the future.

Now imo the best way to do that is encourage couples to stay together as much as possible, so that kids, even if raised poor, have a stable environment with parents always around. But Trudeau probably thinks it's best to give them more money. Which is a band aid on the issue, I guess.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

9055,"Those are some interesting statistics, but they're pointing towards how homelessness affects males more often than females. Poverty doesn't necessarily correlate directly to homelessness, though I can see where that misconception may lie.

[Here are some statistics]( which show percentages of people that are low income for different demographics in 2007-2011. These stats show pretty clearly that women are affected by poverty more often then men. Although it is a small margin, the phrase ""poverty is sexist"" (although I hate that phrase/headline) holds true. If it wasn't true then you would expect to see higher percentages of men in some of the demographics, but this only occurs in a single year for a single demographic (women aged 65+ in an economic family) while many of the demographics have quite a large margin (unattached individuals has a margin of 10% in some cases).

I'm curious as to why women have higher poverty rates, but lower homelessness rates. Perhaps because there are more opportunities available to homeless women to make enough money to rent a house? Perhaps they are more inclined to take these opportunities to provide for any children they may have had? I'm not sure. And I'd love to hear your thoughts on this :)",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
